# Insert chapter 2: Regrsssion and model validation 

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using  

The task had two categories. At first we needed to read a web data and create/combine some variables (data wrangling). It seems that I was successful so far, but I faced issues in the second part where we had to run a simple regression model. I have a good understanding of what is regression model, but faced issue in Rstudio to create on!!
